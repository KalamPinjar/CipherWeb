# CipherWeb
Cipher Web is a comprehensive web application designed to provide users with a wide range of encryption and decryption algorithms. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt plain text using their choice of algorithm and securely store the data in Firebase Cloud Database.

## Features

# 10 Encryption Algorithms: 
Includes CAESAR-CIPHER, RSA-CIPHER, MORSE-CIPHER, VERNAM-CIPHER, VIGENÃˆRE-CIPHER, RAILFENCE-CIPHER, POLYBIUS SQUARE-CIPHER, HUFFMAN-CIPHER, BLOWFISH-CIPHER, and GRONSFELD-CIPHER.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use interface for both encryption and decryption processes.
- **Secure Storage**: Stores encrypted data securely in Firebase Cloud Database, ensuring data integrity and security.
